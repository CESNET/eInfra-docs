## How to choose between computing services?

- [Read computing service overview](./concepts/)
- Check comparision between computing services _(TODO)_

## See how different scientific use-cases are implemented.

- [Cybersecurity platform](./concepts/use-cases/muni-kypo)
- Sensitive data obtaining to processing on cloud infrastructure _(TODO)_
- Computing large scale data at grids _(TODO)_
