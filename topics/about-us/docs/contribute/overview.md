# Documentation overview

This section is about how to contribute to the e-INFRA CZ documentation. The guide is intended for service providers but also for users of the documentation and e-INFRA CZ services, who can participate in building the documentation and thus help other users.

For service providers, a detailed specification of how the documentation is built and works can be useful.
