# Account Management

Your e-INFRA CZ Account and access to the e-INFRA CZ services is managed by 
**e-INFRA CZ AAI** (e-INFRA CZ Authentication and Authorization 
Infrastructure) which is built on top of *[AARC Blueprint Architecture](https://aarc-project.eu/architecture/).*

All basic properties and settings of your account can be viewed and managed in
**e-INFRA CZ User Profile** application at [https://profile.e-infra.cz](https://profile.e-infra.cz)
and most common settings are described in this documentation.

Some services might provide their own administrative and settings
applications which are specific to the nature of the service.
