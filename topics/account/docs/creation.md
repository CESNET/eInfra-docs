Your e-INFRA CZ Account is **automatically created when you try to access
and register within the first service** provided by one or more Operators of
the e-INFRA CZ. You can also *[create your account](https://signup.e-infra.cz/anyfed/registrar/?vo=e-infra.cz)* 
in advance.

!!!note ""
    During the registration **you are required to log in with an 
    account from your home organization (e.g. University)** in order to prove 
    your identity and compliance with *Access Conditions*. Later, you can 
    access your account and services in the same way. See more in 
    [Accessing your account and services](/account/access) section.

## Access Conditions

The creation of e-INFRA CZ Account is open to all persons from the 
academic community in the Czech Republic for the research purposes only.

Exact description can be found in *Access Conditions* document (
[English version](https://www.e-infra.cz/cs/file/8c17a18b8d2d21bade1fe2b4b0efe81c/525/20210408_Podminky_e-INFRA-CZ_EN.pdf)
 / [Czech version](https://www.e-infra.cz/cs/file/59a671ec983f99f18cdf162f4d6cd9ea/380/20210408_Podminky_e-INFRA-CZ_schvaleni.pdf)).

!!! note "Service-specific access conditions"
    In addition to above *Access Conditions*, each e-INFRA CZ sub-service 
    may require its own access conditions usually described on the service 
    registration page.

### Compliance With Access Conditions

Your compliance with *Access Conditions* (especially your affiliation with 
academic organization) is usually evaluated automatically during your 
registration or when accessing the service. Alternatively, you can be 
asked to renew your account periodically, during which the compliance is 
checked again.

Technically, when you log in to your e-INFRA CZ Account or service with an 
account from your home organization (e.g. University), your organization
will issue necessary information about you to us.

In case your compliance can't be evaluated automatically (information is not 
provided by your organization) you might be asked to perform some additional 
steps by service operators.
