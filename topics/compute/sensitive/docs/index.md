!!! warning "Planned changes to the SensitiveCloud service"

    We would like to inform you that on February 26th, 2022 at 5 p.m. (UTC+1), SensitiveCloud service will be undergoing scheduled maintenance to change the login method from MUNI IDP to e-INFRA CZ IDP.

    The expected downtime should not exceed one hour, during which the Rancher portal login will be temporarily unavailable. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and assure you that we will work diligently to ensure a swift and seamless transition.

SensitiveCloud is a computing and storage environment for working with sensitive data. This environment is primarily designed for research in academia, especially in the life sciences and medicine; however, its use is also suitable for sensitive data processing in other areas. For the definition of the processes and the technical design of the environment, the requirements arising from the ISO 27000 family of standards are used; then C5, ISO 15189 and ECRIN.

The environment is built on modern container technology using Kubernetes platform (K8s). It provides a high level of scalability, dynamic environment and other features such as GPU acceleration of computations. Users can choose whether to use one of the predefined containers with frequently used applications or to containerise their applications themselves.
