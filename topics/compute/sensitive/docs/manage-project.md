# Project administration

After we have created a project for you in sensitivecloud, you can manage the following settings as a principal investigator:

- **permissions**, who can access the data and the management portal to manage the computational resources
- the **size of the allocated resources** in case you find that there are insufficient allocated resources for your computations.

## Permissions

Access rights are manageable through the group created for your project, for example `sc_modeling-deathstar-aerodynamics`. In case you have more activities requiring computing resources of SensitiveCloud, you will find more groups starting with `sc_`. Please be careful when selecting the right group when adding/removing members.    
This groups can be found at the following link [perun.e-infra.cz/organizations/3898/groups][vo-einfracz-groups].
