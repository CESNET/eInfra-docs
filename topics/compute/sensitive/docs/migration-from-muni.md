# We Are Expanding to Help All Scientists in the Czech Republic

We are excited to announce that we are expanding our SensitiveCloud service beyond Masaryk University and making it available to the entire e&#8209;INFRA&#160;CZ community. This means that our platform will be accessible to a wider range of researchers and organizations, increasing the potential for collaboration and innovation.

As part of this expansion, we will be changing the way users access the management portal Rancher. Instead of logging in directly via MUNI, users will need to log in via e&#8209;INFRA&#160;CZ. This change will take effect on the 26th of February, 2023.

We understand that changes like this can be disruptive, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. However, we believe that this change will help us to provide an even better service to our users by making the platform more accessible and easier to use.

# How Will This Change Affect You?

**No users deployment and running applications will be affected by this change.**

## Principal Investigators

- From now on, you will have to manage the access to the SensitiveCloud resources for your collaborators exclusively from the identity management system of e&#8209;INFRA&#160;CZ. The system is located at: [perun.eâ€‘infra.cz](https://perun.e-infra.cz).
- New mechanism for managing collaborators over SensitiveCloud resources via applications. [How to add/remove collaborators to SensitiveCloud project](../manage-project)

## Users of SensitiveCloud

- We will change the login capabilities of the __Rancher management portal__ to utilize _e&#8209;INFRA&#160;CZ login_. The login via home organization (MUNI, CUNI, ...) is still available through __e&#8209;INFRA&#160;CZ login__.
- Mandatory multifactor authentication is now handled by _e&#8209;INFRA&#160;CZ login_.
    - Users that are __not__ using _Masaryk University_ as login method to the e&#8209;INFRA&#160;CZ login will have to [add MFA token to their e&#8209;INFRA&#160;CZ Account](/account/mfa/setup/).
    - Users from _Masaryk University_ can use the MFA from home organization, but it's reccomended to also [add MFA token to their e&#8209;INFRA&#160;CZ Account](/account/mfa/setup/).

# When?

The change is planned for 26 February from 17:00 UTC+1 and will last approximately 1 hour until 26 February to 18:00 UTC+1.
