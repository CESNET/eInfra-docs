# How to Get Access

[Access to MetaCentrum Cloud](https://cloud.metacentrum.cz/) is granted to users
with active accounts in one of the following identity federations:

* __EINFRA CESNET__,
* __LIFESCIENCE AAI__`*`.
* __EGI Check-in__`*`,
* __DEEP AAI__`*`.

Users from the Czech academic community should always use the `EINFRA CESNET`
identity provider, unless instructed otherwise by user support.
Identity providers marked with `*` should only be used by international
communities with explicitly negotiated resource allocations.

MetaCentrum Cloud provides the following ways for allocating resources

* __personal project__,
* __group project__.

## Personal Project

A personal project goal is to gain cloud environment knowledge.

!!! caution
	A personal project resource allocation quotas are fixed and cannot be changed.

Personal projects are available automatically to all users of the Czech
e-infrastructure for science, development, and education.

To register, follow the instructions for
[registration in the MetaCentrum VO](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/en/application/index.html).

Personal projects are intended as a low-barrier entry
into the infrastructure for testing and exploration of features.
Any serious resource usage requires the use of a group project, see below.

The following already established terms and conditions apply:

* [Terms and Conditions for Access to the CESNET e-infrastructure](https://www.cesnet.cz/conditions/?lang=en)

## Group Project

!!! notice

Group projects are the primary resource allocation unit for MetaCentrum Cloud.
Any user or a group of users requiring a non-trivial amount of resources must
request a group project using [this form](https://projects.cloud.muni.cz/) and provide the following basic information:

* __name of the project__,
* __purpose of the project__,
* __contact information__,
* __amount and type of requested resources__,
* __impact would the service have on unavailability for 1h, 1d, 1w__,

## Increase Quotas for Existing Group Project

To request quota increase or access to particular [flavor](../technical-reference/flavors.md), please use [this form](https://projects.cloud.muni.cz/).

## Get Access Control Information

__Access control__ is based on information provided by the selected identity federation
and is presented in the form of a VO name and, optionally, a group name. Every user
with an active membership in the specified VO/group will have full access to all resources
of the requested group project. Membership is managed with tools provided by the selected
identity federation, in a self-service manner.

If you already have VO/group, and already using services
provided by the __CESNET e-Infrastructure__ e.g. MetaCentrum, Data Care,
or you represent a project internal to __Masaryk University__,
please visit OpenID Connect User Profile according to your federation:

 - [EINFRA CESNET](https://login.cesnet.cz/oidc/manage/user/profile)
 - [LIFESCIENCE](https://profile.aai.lifescience-ri.eu/profile)
 - EGI (contact EGI support)

and provide us with information that you see on the page. That is going to be __access control information__.

If you don't have VO/group or you know nothing about it, please contact the MUNI Identity Management team
to create a new group within the Unified Login service.

 In the request, describe that you need a group for accessing MetaCentrum Cloud and provide the following information:

* Project/group name
* Project members

After creating a group, you will be provided with a graphical interface for managing group members within the Perun system.
And you will be able to make further adjustments to the member list on your own.
