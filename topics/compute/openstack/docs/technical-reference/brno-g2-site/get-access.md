# How to Get Access

Access to MetaCentrum Cloud is granted to users
with active accounts in one of the following identity federations:

* __EINFRA CESNET__,

Users from the Czech academic community should always use the `EINFRA CESNET`
identity provider, unless instructed otherwise by user support.
Identity providers marked with `*` should only be used by international
communities with explicitly negotiated resource allocations.

MetaCentrum Cloud provides the following ways for allocating resources

* __personal project__,
* __group project__.

## Personal Project

A personal project goal is to gain cloud environment knowledge.

!!! caution
	A personal project resource allocation quotas are fixed and cannot be changed.

Personal projects are available automatically to all users of the Czech
e-infrastructure for science, development, and education.

To register, follow the instructions for
[registration in the MetaCentrum VO](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/en/application/index.html).

Personal projects are intended as a low-barrier entry
into the infrastructure for testing and exploration of features.
Any serious resource usage requires the use of a group project, see below.
