# OpenStack Modules

The following table contains a list of deployed OpenStack services. Services are separated
into two groups based on their stability and the level of support we are able to provide. All services in the production
group are well tested by our team and are covered by our support. To be able to support
a variety of experimental cases we are planning to deploy several services as experimental, which can be useful
for testing purposes, but its functionality won't be covered by our support.
