# Virtual Networking

e-INFRA CZ Cloud offers software-defined networking as one of its services. Users can create their own
networks and subnets, connect them with routers and set up tiered network topologies.

Prerequisites:

* Basic understanding of routing
* Basic understanding of TCP/IP

In How-to guides we have prepared several scenarios:

- [Accessing instances](../how-to-guides/accessing-instances.md)
- [Allocating floating IPs](../how-to-guides/managing-floating-ips.md)
- [Create networking](../how-to-guides/create-networking.md)
- [High Availability deployment](../how-to-guides/high-availability-deployment.md)

For details, refer to [the official documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/train/user/create-networks.html).
