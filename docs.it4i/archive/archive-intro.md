# Introduction

This section contains documentation of decomissioned IT4Innovations' supercomputers.

## Salomon

The second supercomputer, built by SGI (now Hewlett Packard Enterprise), was launched in 2015. With a performance of 2 PFlop/s, it was immediately included in the TOP500 list, which ranks the world's most powerful supercomputers. It stayed there until November 2020, falling from the 40th place to 460th.

Salomon was decomissioned after six years - at the end of 2021.

| Corehours used               | ca. 1,014,000,000  |

## Anselm

The first supercomputer, built by Atos, was launched in 2013. For the first 3 years, it was placed in makeshift containers on the campus of VSB â€“ Technical University of Ostrava, and was subsequently moved to the data room of the newly constructed IT4Innovations building. Anselm's computational resources were available to Czech and foreign students and scientists in fields such as material sciences, computational chemistry, biosciences, and engineering.

At the end of January 2021, after more than seven years, its operation permanently ceased. In the future, it will be a part of the [World of Civilization exhibition][a] in Lower Vitkovice.
