IT4Innovations is a part of [e-INFRA CZ][1] - strategic research infrastructure of the Czech Republic, which provides capacities and resources for the transmission, storage and processing of scientific and research data. In January 2022, IT4I has begun the process of integration of its services. As a part of the process, joint e-INFRA CZ user base will be established.

A part of the integration is a migration of eligible IT4I accounts (i.e. accounts of users affiliated with an academic organizations in the Czech Republic). Users with eligible accounts have already received an email with information about changes in personal data processing.

    Comercial users, training accounts, suppliers, and service accounts will **not** be affected by the migration.

The migration will take place on January 19, 2022. You will receive an email (or emails) from [CESNET][3] that will guide you through additional steps (e.g. password reset or account linking) required to set up your e-INFRA CZ account. Emails will originate from cesnet.cz domain and they will direct you to e-infra.cz pages/web applications.

After the migration process is completed, you will receive a confirmation email from IT4I.
