# Migration of IT4I Accounts to e-INFRA CZ

[e-INFRA CZ][1] is a unique research and development e-infrastructure in the Czech Republic,
which provides capacities and resources for the transmission, storage and processing of scientific and research data.
IT4Innovations has become a member of e-INFRA CZ on January 2022.

The e-INFRA CZ membership has the following implications for IT4I users:

## New IT4I Users

* After the migration all new eligible users will create an account on e-INFRA CZ which will then be propagated to IT4I systems.
* All new non eligible users will create an account following the standard procedure.

## Existing IT4I Users

Users with an existing account will have their account migrated to e-INFRA CZ automatically and ready to use
after finishing the set up according the instructions in the email sent by CESNET.

If you have any question regarding the migration or need help, contact the [support][2].
