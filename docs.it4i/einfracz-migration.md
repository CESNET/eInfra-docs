# Migration to e-INFRA CZ

## Introduction

IT4Innovations is a part of [e-INFRA CZ][1] - strategic research infrastructure of the Czech Republic, which provides capacities and resources for the transmission, storage, and processing of scientific and research data. In January 2022, IT4I has begun the process of integration of its services.

As a part of the process, a joint e-INFRA CZ user base has been established. This included a migration of eligible IT4I accounts.

## Who Is Affected

The migration affects all accounts of users affiliated with an academic organizations in the Czech Republic. Affected users have received an email with information about changes in personal data processing.

## Who Is Not Affected

Commercial users, training accounts, suppliers, and service accounts were **not** affected by the migration.

## When

The migration took place on **January 19, 2022** and finished on **January 21, 2022**.

## Process

During the process, users have received one or more emails from [CESNET][3] guiding them through additional steps required for successful migration.

This may have included:

1. e-INFRA CZ registration, if one does not already exist.
2. e-INFRA CZ password reset, if one does not already exist.
3. Account identity linking, if conflict in username is identified.

Emails originated from `cesnet.cz` domain and directed users to `e-infra.cz` pages/web applications.
The pages are protected by https encryption and valid certificates.

CESNET may have contacted individual users via email when an additional action was required for successful migration of their account.

## Steps After Migration

After the migration, you must use your **e-INFRA CZ credentials** to access all IT4I services as well as [e-INFRA CZ services][5].

Successfully migrated accounts tied to e-INFRA CZ can be self-managed at [e-INFRA CZ User profile][4].

!!! tip "Recommendation"
    We recommend [verifying your SSH keys][6] for cluster access.
