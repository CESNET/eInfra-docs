# Introduction

This section provides basic information on how to gain access to IT4Innovations Information systems and project membership.

## Account Types

There are two types of accounts on IT4Innovations:

* [**e-INFRA CZ Account**][1]
    intended for all persons affiliated with an academic institution from the Czech Republic ([eduID.cz][a]).

* [**IT4I Account**][2]
    intended for all persons who are not eligible for e-INFRA CZ account.

Once you create an account, you can use it only for communication with IT4I support and accessing the SCS information system.
If you want to access IT4I clusters, your account must also be **assigned to a project**.

For more information, see the section:

* [**Get Project Membership**][3]
    if you want to become a collaborator on a project, or

* [**Get Project**][4]
    if you want to become a project owner.
