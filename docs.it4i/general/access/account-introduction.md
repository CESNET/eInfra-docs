# Introduction

This section provides basic information on accounts required for access to IT4I services.
These are the accounts used for communication with IT4I support and accessing the SCS information system.

Creating an account does not automatically grant you access to IT4I clusters and computational resources.
However, with this account, you can apply for computational resources and manage your project and project members (project owner)
or request a project membership (project collaborator).

!!! important
    Be sure to request project or project membership once your account is created.
    Accounts that are not assigned to a project will be deactivated.

## Account Types

There are two types of accounts on IT4I:

* [**e-INFRA CZ Account**][1]
    Intended for all persons affiliated with an academic institution from the Czech Republic (eduID.cz[a]).

* **IT4I Account**
    Intended for all persons who are not eligible for e-INFRA CZ account.
