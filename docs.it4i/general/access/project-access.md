# Get Project Membership

!!! note
    You need to be named as a collaborator by a Primary Investigator (PI) in order to access and use the clusters.

## Authorization by Web

This is a preferred method if you have an IT4I or e-INFRA CZ account.

Log in to the [IT4I SCS portal][a] and go to the **Authorization Requests** section. Here you can submit your requests for becoming a project member. You will have to wait until the project PI authorizes your request.

## Authorization by Email

An alternative way to become a project member is on request sent via [email by the project PI][1].
