# Applying for Resources

Computational resources may be allocated via several [allocation mechanisms][a]:

* Academic researchers may apply via Open Access Competitions.
* Commercial and non-commercial institutions may also apply via the Directors Discretion.
* Foreign (mostly European) users can obtain computational resources via the [PRACE (DECI) program][d].

In all cases, IT4Innovationsâ€™ access mechanisms are aimed at distributing computational resources while taking into account the development and application of supercomputing methods and their benefits and usefulness for society. The applicants are expected to submit a proposal. In the proposal, the applicants **apply for a particular amount of core-hours** of computational resources. The requested core-hours should be substantiated by scientific excellence of the proposal, its computational maturity and expected impacts. The allocation decision is based on the scientific, technical, and economic evaluation of the proposal.
