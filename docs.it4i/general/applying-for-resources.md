# Get Project

The computational resources of IT4I are allocated by the Allocation Committee via several [allocation mechanisms][a] to a project investigated by a Primary Investigator. By allocating the computational resources, the Allocation Committee is authorizing the PI to access and use the clusters. The PI may decide to authorize a number of their collaborators to access and use the clusters to consume the resources allocated to their Project. These collaborators will be associated to the Project. The Figure below is depicting the authorization chain:

**Allocation Mechanisms:**

* Academic researchers may apply via Open Access Competitions.
* Commercial and non-commercial institutions may also apply via the Directors Discretion.
* Foreign (mostly European) users can obtain computational resources via the [PRACE (DECI) program][d].

In all cases, IT4Innovationsâ€™ access mechanisms are aimed at distributing computational resources while taking into account the development and application of supercomputing methods and their benefits and usefulness for society. The applicants are expected to submit a proposal. In the proposal, the applicants **apply for a particular amount of core-hours** of computational resources. The requested core-hours should be substantiated by scientific excellence of the proposal, its computational maturity and expected impacts. The allocation decision is based on the scientific, technical, and economic evaluation of the proposal.
