# About US

[e-INFRA CZ][d] is a unique research and development e-infrastructure in the Czech Republic,
which provides capacities and resources for the transmission, storage, and processing of scientific and research data.

The project, realized between 01/2020 and 12/2022, was declared by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports
in accordance with the Road Map of the Czech Republic for Large Infrastructures for Research, Experimental Development and Innovations.

e-INFRA CZ interconnects all three national e-infrastructures in the Czech Republic â€“ [CESNET][a], [CERIT-SC][b], and [IT4Innovations][c].

## Goals

The goal of the project is to modernise and upgrade current e-infrastructure
in order to provide sufficient capacity of specific e-infrastructure components,
which are necessary for the level of IT infrastructure support to meet the predicted requirements
and needs of the target user community for the given time period and the state-of-the-art of the industry.
Within the context of the basic intent of modernisation and ensuring the required development of e infrastructure,
which is to assist in meeting the trends and requirements of coming years, it is especially necessary to accomplish the following:

* upgrade the parameters and capacity of network communications infrastructure;
* rebuild and further enhance the capacity of infrastructure for demanding calculations;
* boost technological development and expand the capacity of data storage infrastructure.
