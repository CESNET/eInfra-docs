## Required Proficiency

!!! note
    Basic proficiency in Linux environments is required.

In order to use the system for your calculations, you need basic proficiency in Linux environments.
To gain this proficiency, we recommend you read the [introduction to Linux][a] operating system environments,
and install a Linux distribution on your personal computer.
For example, the [CentOS][b] distribution is similar to systems on the clusters at IT4Innovations and it is easy to install and use,
but any Linux distribution would do.

## Errors

Although we have taken every care to ensure the accuracy of the content, mistakes do happen.
If you find an inconsistency or error, please report it by visiting [support][d], creating a new ticket, and entering the details.
By doing so, you can save other readers from frustration and help us improve.
