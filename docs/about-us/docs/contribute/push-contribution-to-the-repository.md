# Publish changes to the main repository

### Commit and Push Changes

If you are satisfied with your changes and you did build the whole documentation to review you changes in the context of the whole site commit and push changes to main respository:

```console
git commit -am "Commit message"
git push --set-upstream origin my_change
```

### Submit Changes

Create a *Merge Request* via GitLab @ ICS MU.

## Simple Merge Request (using GitLab web interface)

This option is suitable for less extensive contribution
(e.g. a section or a subsection) of an already existing page).

In this case, simply:

1. click the **Edit this page**
under the Table of Content on the right side of the respective page;
1. make the changes;
1. create a merge request.
