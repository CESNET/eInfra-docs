# Use Cases

## KYPO

The [KYPO](https://crp.kypo.muni.cz/en) - Cyber Exercise & Research Platform (KYPO) project aims to create an unique environment for research and development of new methods to protect critical infrastructure against cyber attacks. A developed virtualized environment will be used for simulation of complex cybernetic attacks against critical infrastructure and analyze their behavior and impact on the infrastructure. The KYPO will serve for research and development of new security tools and methods. In addition, it will be used for educating members of security teams.

## Cerit-SC

Cloud (HPC) computing built using Openstack.

## Courses and Labs

On demand virtual training & hands-on labs

## Mycroft Mind

[Mycroft Mind](https://www.mycroftmind.com/) creates models and simulations to help energy suppliers respond to important technical questions concerning ways of developing distribution grids.

## Galaxy

Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research.

## WeNMR

The objective of WeNMR is to optimize and extend the use of the NMR and SAXS research infrastructures through the implementation of an e-infrastructure in order to provide the user community with a platform integrating and streamlining the computational approaches necessary for NMR and SAXS data analysis and structural modelling. Access to the e-NMR infrastructure is provided through a portal integrating commonly used software and GRID technology.

## Peachnote.com

Peachnote is a music score search engine and analysis platform. The system is the first of its kind and can be thought as an analog of Google Books Ngram Viewer and Google Books search for music scores. Hundreds of thousands of music scores are being digitized by libraries all over the world. In contrast to books, they generally remain inaccessible for content-based retrieval and algorithmic analysis. There is no analogue to Google Books for music scores, and there exist no large corpora of symbolic music data that would empower musicology in the way large text corpora are empowering computational linguistics, sociology, history, and other humanities that have printed word as their major source of evidence about their research subjects. We want to help change that. Peachnote provides visitors and researchers access to a massive amount of symbolic music data.

## WS-PGRADE

WS-PGRADE is a portal environment for the development, execution and monitoring of workflows and workflow based parameter studies on different Distributed Computing Infrastructures (DCI). The tool is developed by an open consortium lead by MTA SZTAKI, member of the Hungarian NGI. WS-PGRADE is used by various scientific collaborations and support teams in Europe and beyond. WS-PGRADE is interfaced with Service Grids (gLite, UNICORE, ARC, Globus), Desktop Grids (BOINC) and cluster (PBS, LFS) middleware through the elements of the gUSE service stack. WS-PGRADE and gUSE are actively used and further developed in the SHIWA and SCI-BUS FP7 projects.

## GAIA-Space

Gaia is a global space astrometry mission. Its goal is to make the largest, most precise three-dimensional map of our Galaxy by surveying an unprecedented number of stars - more than a thousand million.

## BNCWeb

BNCWeb is an interface to the British National Corpus, a dataset of 100 million words, carefully sampled from a wide range of texts and conversations to provide a snapshot of British English in the late 20th century. This is a key reference work in English studies, linguistics and language teaching and is widely used in a wide variety of computational linguistic applications. BNCWeb offers powerful search and analysis functions for searching the text and exploiting the detailed textual metadata. It is an open source project, and the BNC is freely available for educational and research purposes.

## DIRAC

The DIRAC interware project provides a framework for building ready to use distributed computing systems. It has been proven to be a useful tool for large international scientific collaborations integrating in a single system, their computing activities and distributed computing resources: Grids, Clouds and HTC clusters. In the case of Cloud resources, DIRAC is currently integrated with Amazon EC2, OpenNebula, OpenStack and CloudStack. Some Monte Carlo (MC)simulation campaign were realized at the large scale project Belle II, providing over 10.000 thousand CPU days from Amazon. Until this use case in Fedcloud-tf, all cases have made used of a single cloud at a time. The work integrates the resources provided by the multiple private clouds of the EGI Federated Cloud and additional WLCG resources, providing high-level scientific services on top of them by using the DIRAC framework. New design has been adopted by a federated hybrid cloud architecture (Rafhyc). Initial integration and scaling tests demonstrates the architecture is valid to manage federated hybrid cloud IaaS to provide eScience SaaS. The solution has been adopted by LHCb DIRAC for the LHCb computing on federated clouds, using end-points just like another computing resource.

## CSGF

The Catania Science Gateway Framework (CSGF) has been developed by INFN, Division of Catania (Italy), to provide application developers with a tool to create Science Gateways in short time and in a very easy way. CSGF is made of a set of libraries to manage Authentication & Authorization mechanisms and to interact with several different kinds of DCIs (grid, cloud, HPC, local, etc.). The CSGT would like to use the EGI Federated Cloud to develop a new CSGF plugin implementing the service model SaaS exploiting OCCI. The use case is an interoperability test, implemented as a new Liferay portlet in CSGF, to make the portal capable of submitting applications to the EGI Federated Cloud, grids and HPC resources in a user-trasparent way.

## ChainReds

In addition to CSGF, this project provides unified web interface for large-scale multi-cloud platform deployments. Itâ€™s a new and easy way of accessing a global computing grid and the processing power of tens of thousands of cores are at the fingertips of anyone: researcher, student, or citizen scientist.

## BioVel

BioVeL provides workflows for the processing of data in major areas of biodiversity research: population modelling, ecosystem functioning, and taxonomy.
