# Virtual networking

MetaCentrum Cloud offers software-defined networking as one of its services. Users can create their own
networks and subnets, connect them with routers and set up tiered network topologies.

Prerequisites:

* Basic understanding of routing
* Basic understanding of TCP/IP

In How-to guides we have prepared several scenarios:

- [Accessing instances](/OpenStack/how-to-guides/accessing-instances/)
- [Allocating floating IPs](/OpenStack/how-to-guides/allocating-floating-ips/)
- [Create networking](/OpenStack/how-to-guides/create-networking/)
- [High Availability deployment](/OpenStack/how-to-guides/high-availability-deployment/)

For details, refer to [the official documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/train/user/create-networks.html).
