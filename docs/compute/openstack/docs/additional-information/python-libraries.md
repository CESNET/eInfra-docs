# Python libraries

Other than Terraform and OpenStack CLI, it is also possible to manage the OpenStack
by Python SDK and create custom Python scripts for cloud management.

To install the SDK, use `pip`:

```
pip install openstacksdk
```

Full documentation of the OpenStack SDK with examples is available in official [OpenStack docs](https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/train/user/index.html).
