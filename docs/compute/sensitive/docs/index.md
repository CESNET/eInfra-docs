SensitiveCloud is a computing and storage environment for working with sensitive data. This environment is primarily designed for research in academia, especially in the life sciences and medicine; however, its use is also suitable for sensitive data processing in other areas. For the definition of the processes and the technical design of the environment, the requirements arising from the ISO 27000 family of standards are used; then C5, ISO 15189 and ECRIN.

## About environemnt
The environment is built on modern container technology using Kubernetes platform (K8s). It provides a high level of scalability, dynamic environment and other features such as GPU acceleration of computations. The solution thus does not require the laborious deployment and management of entire virtual machines with their own operating systems, but rather containerises the applications themselves. Users can choose whether to use one of the predefined containers with frequently used applications or to containerise their applications themselves.

## Provider
The SensitiveCloud environment is provided by CERIT-SC, which is an organisational unit of the Institute of Computing at Masaryk University and one of the three members of the large research infrastructure e-INFRA CZ.
